    Clicked the Link: A Realistic Phishing Incident
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}A nurse named Fatima at a Lagos
    hospital opened an urgent-looking email from the “Director” about patient
    records. The email even had the hospital logo and sounded official. Thinking
    it was real, Fatima clicked the link inside. Unbeknownst to her, this one
    click let a virus into the hospital’s computer network, beginning a chain
    reaction of problems.

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Attack Unfolds</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    At first, nothing seemed wrong – but soon Fatima’s computer slowed down. The
    virus quietly spread to shared drives and other PCs. Within hours, staff
    found they couldn’t open patient files or lab reports. A ransomware message
    popped up on the director’s screen, demanding payment in cryptocurrency to
    “unlock” the files. Labs and clinics went on hold while IT worked through
    the night. In this scene, the attackers had used a familiar name (the
    hospital director) to exploit staff
    trust:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. Only later did Fatima learn
    that the “Director’s” email address was actually a fake personal account. If
    Fatima had asked for confirmation or noticed the small red flags, the attack
    might have been stopped early.

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Lessons Learned</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
    <li>
      <strong>Think Before You Click:</strong> Always pause and confirm any
      unexpected email, even if it looks
      official:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. If it asks for urgent
      actions (like sending money or logging in), verify by calling the sender
      or checking with a manager.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Keep Systems Updated:</strong> Install software updates and
      security patches on computers right
      away:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. Also back up important
      patient data regularly. If malware does get in, backups let you restore
      files without paying a ransom.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Speak Up and Stay Protected:</strong> Report any suspicious email
      immediately. Follow clear reporting rules so the security team can act
      fast:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. Use strong passwords,
      multi-factor authentication, and up-to-date antivirus tools as extra
      layers of defense:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-4">
    This incident shows that even a busy, well-meaning nurse can be fooled by a
    clever scam. Fortunately, in Fatima’s case the virus was detected before
    patient harm occurred. The hospital learned a hard lesson: cybersecurity is
    everyone’s responsibility. Staff and management must work together – train
    regularly on phishing threats, keep security software current, and don’t
    hesitate to verify strange emails. As one security expert advises, building
    a culture of reporting and strong passwords helps stop these attacks at the
    door:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.
    It only takes one click to start a disaster, but it also takes just one
    report or question to stop it. Let’s make sure that in our hospitals,
    everyone stays alert and phishing attempts are a thing of the past.
